Customer Segmentation with K-means Clustering

Overview

This project focuses on creating a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of marketing and business strategy, as it helps to tailor products, services, and marketing campaigns to specific customer groups, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and increasing sales.

## Kaggle Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about customers' purchase history. The dataset includes features such as customer ID, purchase amount, frequency of purchases, and other relevant information.

## Model Used

The K-means clustering algorithm is employed to group customers based on similarities in their purchase behavior. K-means is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions data into k clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
